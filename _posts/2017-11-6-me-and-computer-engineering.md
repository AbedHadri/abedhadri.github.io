Abed Hadri is a passionate web developer who is always eager to learn more and more about technology and software. The beginning was all when I moved to Turkey leaving my previous university and 2 years of studying in telecommunications engineering behind and was completely eager to study computer engineering.

## Studying in Turkey
I had to prepare very hard in order to pass the exams required for the universities in Turkey and actually did!! studying extensively for 3 months did the trick and I took up studying in Çukurova University.

coming from a country that was torn apart by war held me responsible for more things than I should, and I had to act before it was too late. I could not wait till graduation , I have already wasted enough time by that date. so I took up working firstly as a translator  between the languages I know (Turkish , Arabic  and of course English).

## Starting career in software
Income from that work did not satisfy my needs so I took up working for free with some startup that was in the city I live in (Adana). I quickly became adapted to web development in PHP along with HTML and CSS and simple JS. I still remember the happiness that flown within me while watching my first application doing what it had to flawlessly and getting data from the database and displaying it within a table ! Although I was aware that I’m doing it for no free but the sense of achievement was priceless.

## Starting career in KeySoft
at that year (2016) I went to a website called kariyer.net and did only one job application that got me my first professional job by May 2016 and started working for a company called KeySoft.

Although there were no web developers in KeySoft but I managed to learn a lot when I decided to work extremely hard to get the work done on time. when the school started it was even worse. I could barely get 3 or 4 hours of sleep since I had to manage for both university and work. I would sometimes skip classes in order to do some work.

although it was a very difficult year but it was full of achievements as I could develop apps easily with Java , PHP as well as on frontend too.
